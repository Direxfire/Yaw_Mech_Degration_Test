<H1>Vision Aerial Yaw-Mech Degration Test</H1>
<H2> Goal </H2>

1. Test motor casing seperation
2. Test servo slop 
3. Monitr hub connector for failure
4. Monitor servo internal gearing failure

<H2>Testing Methodology</H2>
<ul>
<li>Run motor at approximately normal running speed</li>
<li>Move the servo through 3 positions conintously (Center, Left, Right)</li>
<li>Run for 5 twice a day</li>
</ul>

<H2> Measurment Proceedure </H2>
<ul>
<li>Measure the relative seperation of the motor from casing</li>
<li>Measure maximum movable servo slop while not forcing the gearing to move </li>
<li>Inspect Hub for any damage</li>
<li>Inspect testing apperatus for additional damage or part fatigue</li>
</ul>

<H4>Code</H4>
<p>This repository contains the code for the embedded MSP4330FR2310 running the testing system.</p>
<p>The code is written in embedded C using the Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio IDE. This is the softwaree developed specifically for programming these microcontrollers. When editing the code base, notations must be added for date modiftied and what was modified in the changelog.md file. For proper functionality, the Code Composer Studio Optomizer must be disabled otherwise the system will not function.</p>
<H4>Circuit Diagram</H4>
<p>The circuit diagram and any future schematics developed will be located on the Google Drive. Please refer to the Google Drive for all up-to-date documentation</p>
<H4>Measurement Forms</H4>
<p>All mesurement forms are located on Google Drive. Please refer to Google Drive for the most up-to-date forms</p>
